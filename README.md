BLOCKET PRICE LISTINGS PREDICTIONS ON VOLVO CARS

This project built a regression model that predicted the price that a Volvo might be listed for based on several key features that were built into the model. 

Many statistical tests were undertaken to identify the key features in the dataset and then the model was tested on unseen data, where it performed relatively well.

The important thing to note in this model is that it is not trying to predict what a car will be listed for - as human error is prevalent in car listings, hence the idea of a 'good deal', and a 'bad deal', but rather the model suggests a price that is reasonable
considering the key features of the car.

There are several improvements that could be made to it that are highlighted in the written report. 

Most of the analysis here was built in RStudio.
